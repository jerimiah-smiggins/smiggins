# Backend Docs
Docs for the backend. This contains descriptions of every function defined in
any of the files in the backend.

## ./manage.py
This file is auto-created when making a django project. To see what this file
does, you can read the django docs or run the file like you would a normal
python file (`python3 manage.py`). The most useful commands are:
- `python3 manage.py runserver` - Starts a web server locally for you to test
  your code
- `python3 manage.py migrate` - Migrates the database from one version to
  another. If you make changes to the models, you will need to run the next
  command.
- `python3 manage.py makemigrations` - Takes any changes to the models and turns
  them into files in the migrations folder that can be used to upgrade the data
  in the database.
- `python3 manage.py addsuperuser` - Adds a username/password that can be used
  to access the `/django-admin` page. This is stored in the database, so if you
  ever reset that, you will need to re-add any of these you have added.
- `python3 manage.py collectstatic` - Collects any static files into another
  folder. This should be used when creating a production server, and shouldn't
  ever need to be used in normal debugging.

thing this is being used for is the extra string that is added to hashed
passwords in order to make them harder to crack.

```py
auth_key: bytes
```
This is the string that is added to password hashes to make them harder to
reverse engineer.

## ./backend/_settings.py
This file is for any settings that the server runner should be able to change.
This shouldn't be anything that is overridden by the server when it is ran, nor
should it contain variables that are meant to just exist as a global and aren't
meant to be configured. Everything in the file is commented and should be easy
enough to understand.

```py
VERSION: str
```
The version that's displayed on the frontend.

```py
SITE_NAME: str
```
The name of the site that is displayed on the frontend.

```py
OWNER_USER_ID: int
```
The user id of the instance owner. Defaults to one. This can be found on the
`/django-admin` page, assuming you have a superuser account (see `./manage.py`)

```py
DEBUG: bool
```
Whether or not to automatically reload the server when the backend files change.
This should be `False` on development servers.

```py
ADMIN_LOG_PATH: str
```
The path of the admin log file. Set to `None` to not log any admin activity

```py
MAX_ADMIN_LOG_LINES: int
```
The maximum of lines of logs to store in the admin file at once. Minimum is one

```py

```
The default language of the server. Should be chosen from one of the files in
the `./lang/` folder, omitting the `.json` file extension. Ex: `"en-US"`

```py
CACHE_LANGUAGES: bool
```
Whether or not to cache languages. If this is on, then more ram will be used to
store them, however in the long run it will take a bit less CPU usage and disk
usage. If you are testing/creating a language, turn this OFF to make the
language refresh automatically.

```py
ALLOW_SCRAPING: bool
```
Whether or not to legally allow other services to scrape your website. This does
NOT affect indexing for search engines. This is done by setting the
`TDM-Reservation` header to 0 if allowed, 1 if disallowed. Read more here:
https://www.w3.org/community/reports/tdmrep/CG-FINAL-tdmrep-20240202/

```py
MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH: int
```
The maximum length for a username. Must be between 1 and 200.

```py
MAX_DISPL_NAME_LENGTH: int
```
The maximum length for a display name. Must be between 1 and 200.

```py
MAX_POST_LENGTH: int
```
The maximum length for a post. Must be between 1 and 65,536

```py
MAX_BIO_LENGTH: int
```
The maximum length for a user bio. Must be between 1 and 65,536

```py
DEFAULT_BANNER_COLOR; str
```
The default color for banners. This should be a hex code with the format
`#XXXXXX` where an X is a number 0-9 or a letter a-f, case insensitive.

```py
POSTS_PER_REQUEST: int
```
The amount of posts to send at a time when the client requests the list. A
larger number would result in more CPU usage and bandwidth, however may
positively affect the user experience.

```py
MESSAGES_PER_REQUEST: int
```
The maximum amount of private messages to send per request.

```py
MAX_NOTIFICATIONS: int
```
The maximum notifications to store for a single user at a time. Whenever this
number is exceeded, it will remove the oldest notifications for that user until
the amount of notifications goes below the threshold.

```py
CONTACT_INFO: list[list[str]]
```
A list containing contact information that would be put on the contact page.
It is a list of lists, where the inside list has two strings. The first string
is the type, which can be `email`, `url`, or `text`. `email` is for emails,
`url` for links, and `text` for other text that wouldn't fit with either of the
other options.

```py
POST_WEBHOOKS: dict[str, list[str]]
```
Automatically sends a request to the specified webhook when a user posts a post
(comments aren't included). Format below. Type should be either "raw" (sends the
data with a POST request with the data in the "content" json parameter) or
"discord" (sends the data in a discord style embed). Webhooks may be subject to
ratelimits by external servers depending on frequency

```py
SOURCE_CODE: bool
```
Whether or not to include links to the github page.

```py
RATELIMIT: bool
```
Whether or not to enforce the rate limits.

```py

- `signup unsuccessful`
- `signup successful`
- `login unsuccessful`
- `login successful`
- `create comment`
- `create comment failure`
- `create post`
- `create post failure`

```py
ENABLE_USER_BIOS: bool
```
Whether or not to enable user bios. If this gets disabled, any previously set
bios will not be deleted and show up again if this is reenabled. (This applies
to the next few settings up to `ENABLE_QUOTES`)

```py
ENABLE_PRONOUNS: bool
```
Whether or not to enable pronouns.

```py
ENABLE_GRADIENT_BANNERS: bool
```
Whether or not to enable gradient banners.

```py
ENABLE_BADGES: bool
```
Whether or not to enable badges. When disabled, this basically makes admin level
three useless. Private account icons will still show up.

```py
ENABLE_PRIVATE_MESSAGES: bool
```
Whether or not to enable private messages.

```py
ENABLE_QUOTES: bool
```
Whether or not to allow quoting posts. If this gets disabled, any already quotes
that already exist will stay and still show up normally.

```py
ENABLE_POST_DELETION: bool
```
Whether or not to allow deleting posts. This applies to BOTH admins AND normal
users.

```py
ENABLE_HASHTAGS: bool
```
Whether or not to enable hashtags. Disabling this causes hashtags to not show up
as links on the frontend, and the `/hashtag/...` pages not work. Hashtags are
still logged like normal even if this is disabled, meaning that if you enable it,
any posts posted while this was disabled that had hashtags will still show up on
the hashtag pages.

## ./backend/helper.py
This is for any helper function that could be used across the backend. This is
for utility functions, things that make an action easier, and other stuff like
that.

```py
def sha(
  string: str | bytes
) -> str
```
Returns the sha256 hash of the byte array/string.

```py
def set_timeout(
  callback: Callable,
  delay_ms: int | float
) -> NoReturn
```
A recreation of JavaScript's `setTimeout()` function. Runs the function
`callable` after `delay_ms` milliseconds have passed. This runs on a separate
thread so it shouldn't affect any code that's running at the same time.

```py
def get_HTTP_response(
  request: django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIRequest,
  file: str,
  **kwargs: Any
) -> django.http.HttpResponse
```
Returns an http response object that returns the formatted template `file`. Any
values in `kwargs` will be template keys that will be used when rendering the
template.

```py
def create_simple_return(
  template_path: str,
  redirect_logged_out: bool=False,
  redirect_logged_in: bool=False,
  content_type: str="text/html",
  content_override: str | None=None
) -> Callable[Any, HttpResponse | HttpResponseRedirect]
```
Returns a simple lambda function that, when called, acts like a normal request
function. Normally, it will render and return the file at `template_path`.
However, if `redirect_logged_out` or `redirect_logged_in` are true, it may
return a redirect object. If `redirect_logged_out` is true and the user who
made the request is not logged in, then it will return a redirect object to the
index page of the site. If `redirect_logged_in` is true, then it will return a
response object that redirects to the home page. If `content_override` has
content, then it will override any template that would normally be rendered and
instead return a response object with the content being the literal value of
`content_override` with no templating done to it, and with the content type of
`content_type`. `content_type` is otherwise ignored.

```py
def validate_token(
  token: str
) -> bool
```
Returns `True` if a token is valid and `False` if it isn't.

```py
def generate_token(
  username: str,
  password: str
) -> str
```
Returns the token associated with a specific username and password hash.

```py
def validate_username(
  username: str,
  existing: bool = False
) -> int
```
Makes sure a specific username is valid. If `existing` is true, it checks if all
the characters in the username are valid, and if they are it will check if the
username exists, and if it does, returns `1`, and `0` if it doesn't. If
`existing` is false, however, it does the same checks as above, returning `-1`
instead of `1`, and instead of instantly returning `0` if the username doesn't
exist, it checks to make sure the username has the correct amount of characters,
between 1 and `MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH`.

```py
def create_api_ratelimit(
  api_id: str,
  time_ms: int | float,
  identifier: str | None
) -> NoReturn
```
Starts a ratelimit timing for the api id `api_id`, which is often just the name
of the function that calls this. The `identifier` is a further identification,
usually the user's IP address or token. The `time_ms` is how long the ratelimit
should last.

```py
def ensure_ratelimit(
  api_id: str,
  identifier: str | None
) -> bool
```
This checks to see if a certain `identifier` for the specified `api_id` is
currently being ratelimited. `True` means that there is no ratelimit, and
`False` means that it is being ratelimited.

```py
def get_badges(
  user: posts.models.User
) -> list[str]
```
Returns a list of badges for the specified user object.

```py
def get_post_json(
  post_id: int,
  current_user_id: int = 0,
  comment: bool = False
) -> dict[str, Any]
```
Returns the post information in a JSON format for the specified post id.
`current_user_id` is used for validating private accounts, and `comment`
determines if it should be treated as a comment or a post.

```py
def trim_whitespace(
  string: str,
  purge_newlines: bool = False
) -> str
```
Trims whitespace and replaces invisible characters with normal spaces. Used when
creating posts of any kind, or when changing display names. If `purge_newlines`
is true, then all newlines will be replaced with spaces.

```py
def log_admin_action(
    action_name: str,
    admin_user_object: posts.models.User,
    log_info: str
) -> NoReturn
```
Logs an administrative action.

```py
def find_mentions(
  message: str,
  exclude_users: list[str] = []
) -> list[str]
```
Returns a list of users mentioned in the string `message`, excluding any of the
users listed in `exclude_users`. For example, the string `"hi @trinkey"` would
return `["trinkey"]`, assuming `"trinkey"` isn't in `exclude_users`. Duplicates
are automatically removed.

```py
def find_mentions(
  message: str
) -> list[str]
```
Returns a list of hashtags in the string `message`. For example, the string
`"i love #cats! #CatPerson alert"` would return `["cats", "catperson"]`.
Duplicates are automatically removed.

```py
def create_notification(
    is_for: User,
    event_type: str,
    event_id: int
) -> NoReturn
```
Creates a new Notification object using the specified parameters.

```py
def get_lang(
  user: User | None = None
) -> dict[str, Any]
```
Returns the language dict for the specified user, or the default configured in
`./backend/_settings.py` if no user is specified.

## Notice
here at smiggins incorporated (real company trust), we like to promote a kind
and inclusive argument. this means that **zero racism, sexism, homophobia,
etc. will be tolerated** in anywhere related to this project, including github
issues, the discord server, and the official main instance. if you think that
someone violates this and you believe that they are doing something wrong, feel
free to reach out to [@trinkey](https://github.com/trinkey). if you don't agree
with this, then don't start drama about it, just leave and pretend smiggins
doesn't exist.
